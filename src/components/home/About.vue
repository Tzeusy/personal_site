        I'm a Singaporean with too much enthusiasm for technology and too little appreciation for art. I enjoy reading about geopolitics, debating about ethics, and over-analyzing rational fiction. This site is a consolidation of my experiences across the various worlds I immerse myself in - be they my latest learnings in the big field of software, my thoughts and ruminations on the fantastical universes of my SF/F exploration, or even just my reflections about arbitrary topics.
        <br><br>
        This is as much an effort to force myself to think with clarity as it is the crystallization of a desire to set something concrete down with my daily life. Welcome to my profile!
